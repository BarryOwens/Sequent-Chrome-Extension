											<h1>Privacy Statement	</h1>									<br>
											<br>

This Privacy Statement provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information. Users can access the sequent service (the "Service") through our website https://www.barryowens.net/sequent/login.html. A "Device" is any computer used to access the Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Statement governs your access of the Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Statement. All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as "information."
<h2>1. The Information We Collect to create playlists</h2>
We collect Facebook posts by group members in groups you are a member of. We will not share this data with others. It is used to create playlists for you. 
Log Data.   When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier and other interactions with the Service.
Cookies.   We may also use "cookies" to collect information and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use "persistent cookies" to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use "session ID cookies" to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.
<h2>2. How We Use Personal Information</h2>
Analytics.   We also collect some information (ourselves or using third party services) using logging and cookies, such as IP address, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information. We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service's technical administration, to increase our Service's functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for the Service to process their requests. As of the date this statement went into effect, we use Google Analytics.

By continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Statement.
